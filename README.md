# Diagnosing Pneumothorax in X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning, specifically a **uXception-based model**, to **identify and segment pneumothorax** (collapsed lung) in chest X-ray images. The goal is to automate pneumothorax detection to assist clinical diagnosis, although the current results suggest further improvements are needed for real-world application.

## Abstract
Manual segmentation of medical images is labor-intensive and prone to error. We implement a neural network-based approach using an adapted uXception architecture with a combined **binary cross-entropy** and **log-dice loss** function. 
- Dataset: SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Kaggle Dataset.
- Achieved a **mean Dice coefficient of ~30.03%** and a **total Dice coefficient of ~37.85%**.
- Model limitations due to factors like downsampling, learning rate decay, and challenges with data augmentation.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resized X-ray images from 1024Ã—1024 to 128Ã—128 to reduce computational demands.
- **Model Architecture**: Modified uXception model with ImageNet pretrained weights (Transfer Learning).
- **Training**:
  - 1802 images used for training.
  - 200 images for validation.
  - 377 images for testing.
- **Loss Functions**:
  - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.
  - Log-Dice Loss.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation)
- Images are labeled using pixelwise masks and encoded via Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

## Key Findings
- **Challenges**: Data imbalance, augmentation issues, and detail loss during downsampling.
- **Results**: Model shows potential but is not reliable enough for direct clinical deployment.
- **Insights**: More sophisticated augmentation, higher resolution training, and different architectures could improve performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU for faster training

## How to Run
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Download and prepare the SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax dataset.
3. Train the model using the provided scripts.
4. Evaluate the model using test images and generate Dice coefficient scores.
